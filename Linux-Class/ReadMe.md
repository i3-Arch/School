(1A) Download 'lazy' script by running 
			wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/i3-Arch/School/master/Linux-Class/lazy
 	
	(1B) If running OpenSuse download like so
				wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/i3-Arch/School/master/Linux-Class/lazyOPENSUSE 


(2) Then run          source lazyOPENSUSE         or       source lazy        ( depending on what your running obviously ) 

The 'lazy' script will download the script and file it needs
		then unzip files, then rm the .zip
		 then cd and chmod 741 the script
	  		    then it runs it..

				The actual script I made for class is called 
								script
						Its just a simple menu script
